# Network Security Project

## Goal

The goal of the Network Security Project was to enhance network security by conducting vulnerability scanning, implementing proactive defense measures, and analyzing packet data. The project focused on the following objectives:

- Identify and address network vulnerabilities through comprehensive vulnerability scanning using Nmap and Wireshark.
- Strengthen the network's defense mechanisms by implementing proactive measures, including firewall rule configurations.
- Monitor and prevent unauthorized activities by implementing logging systems.
- Gain insights into network traffic and identify potential security risks through packet analysis using Wireshark.

## Key Highlights

- Conducted comprehensive vulnerability scanning using Nmap and Wireshark to identify potential weaknesses within the network.
- Implemented proactive defense measures by configuring firewall rules to fortify the network's defense mechanisms.
- Established logging systems to monitor and prevent unauthorized activities, contributing to an overall robust security posture.
- Analyzed packet data using Wireshark to gain insights into network traffic and identify potential security risks.
